# tictactoez

## Introduction

This is my first attempt to create a Tic Tac Toe game. It's a very simple one and can only run in CLI.

Player can choose to play with a computer or with another human player.

## Instructions

To run this game, copy/clone this repo. In command-line go to the repo directory and run 'bundle install'. After successfully completing the bundle-install,
run 'ruby bin/tictactoe'.

## Tests
 I have used Rspec to add some tests in the 'spec' folder. To run the test just run 'rspec' in the terminal.
