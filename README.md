# tictactoez

## Introduction

This is my first attempt to create a Tic Tac Toe game. It's a very simple one and can only run in CLI.

Player can choose to play with a computer or with another human player.

Updated 10/4/18: Removed the Hardcoded combos for win detection. Human and AI games winning will be analyzed by row, columns and diagonals checking. But AI still checks the best moves or the winning moves based on the pre-written combos, not related to win detection. 

## Instructions

To run this game, copy/clone this repo. In command-line go to the repo directory and run 'bundle install'. After successfully completing the bundle-install,
run 'ruby bin/tictactoe'.

## Tests
 I have used Rspec to add some tests in the 'spec' folder. To run the test just run 'rspec' in the terminal.
